      <h3>Clone</h3>
             <p class="description">
                  Running this code allows you to run a local copy of a repositry and syncs them.
             </p>
             <P>You clone a repository by copying the link to the repository and pasting it after typing git clone like so: <code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY</code></P>
             <p class="explanation">
                  You can clone a repository from GitHub.com to your local computer, or to a codespace, to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine, or to a remote virtual machine when you create a codespace. For more information about cloning to a codespace, see Creating a codespace for a repository.
            </p>
             <p class="explanation">
                  Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.com, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.com. For more information, see Using Git.
             </p>
             <p class="explanation">
                  You can clone your existing repository or clone another person's existing repository to contribute to a project.

      <h3>Commit</h3>
             <p class="description"> Running this will record changes you made, when they were made and by who. </p>
             <p>To use commit type git commit -m"" then put the message in the in the quotation marks: <code>git commit -m "update the README.md with link to contributing guide"</code> </p>
             <p class="explanation">When you make a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes.</p>
             <p class="explanation">If the repository you are committing to has compulsory commit signoffs enabled, and you are committing via the web interface, you will automatically sign off on the commit as part of the commit process.</p>

 <section id="pull">
      <h3>Pull</h3>
             <p class="description">Allows you to automatically update your local repo with the content of the remoter repository</p>
             <p>To update your local repository, all you have to do is type git pull in the terminal you are working on: <code>git pull</code></p>
             <p class="explanation">The git pull command first runs git fetch which downloads content from the specified remote repository. Then a git merge is executed to merge the remote content refs and heads into a new local merge commit.</p>

 <section id="push">
      <h3>Push</h3>
             <p class="description">Updates the main repository with the changes made on a local one.</p>
             <p>The gir push command accepts two arguments, the remote name and the branch name: <code>git push REMOTE-NAME BRANCH-NAME</code></p>
             <p class="explanation">After you make and commit changes locally, you can share them with the remote repository using git push. Pushing changes to the remote makes your commits accessible to others who you may be collaborating with. This will also update any open pull requests with the branch that you're working on.</p>
             <p class="explanation">As best practice, it's important to run the git pull command before you push any new changes to the remote branch. This will update your local branch with any new changes that may have been pushed to the remote from other contributors. Pulling before you push can reduce the amount of merge conflicts you create on GitHub â€“ allowing you to resolve them locally before pushing your changes to the remote branch.</p>
